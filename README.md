Code provided in fulfilment of Module 4 Assignment on the edX [Asynchronous Programming with Javascript](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:Microsoft+DEV234x+3T2017a/course/) course.

The demo can be found on [on my website: /demos/ship-comparison](http://jbrowne.io/demos/ship-comparison).

## Development
If you have NPM, there is a package.json that pulls in eslint as a development dependency when you run `npm install`. You can therefore use `npm run lint` to lint the JavaScript file. Your IDE may support this as well.
